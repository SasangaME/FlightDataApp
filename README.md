<h1>Flight Data App</h1>

<h2>Use Case</h2>

we have a fictitious airline company that keeps track of
aircraft, their planned flights and operating costs.
They require an application where users can upload a list of upcoming scheduled flights and
view the calculated cost of each flight displayed on screen. Once the data has been
uploaded and the initial cost calculation done, then users can edit the number of passengers
or add\edit a note on the flight.
